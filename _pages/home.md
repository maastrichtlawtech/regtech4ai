#    <p>Prompt: Visualize a logo that portrays a pathway, symbolizing the journey from AI innovation to regulatory compliance. This path should start from a stylized AI icon, winding its way through a series of legal symbols (like a document with a seal, a gavel) and leading to a harmonious coexistence symbol represented by a perfectly balanced scale embedded within a digital landscape. Use a color scheme that conveys clarity and optimism, such as light blues and greens.</p>

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a conerstone of the regulation of AI in the EU. It seeks to facilitate the flow of data across the EU while protecting citizens’ fundamental rights – including data protection and privacy. Even though the GDPR is now more than 7 years old, there remain significant gaps between the law and practice. For example, past research by the project lead showed that less than 10% of mobile apps fulfil the minimum legal requirements regarding *consent* – one of the core principles of GDPR.

As the EU is introducing the *AI Act* (i.e. its first law aimed directly at AI), it is likely that again – like with GDPR – enforcement will be lagging and that businesses will be overwhelmed by the legal obligations. In response, **RegTech4AI** will research *regulatory technologies* (RegTech) to assist enforcement agencies and businesses with AI regulation, and thereby bolster trust in AI systems among citizens.

The aim of this project is *not* to develop new AI frameworks or laws (as this has been studied much before). Instead, **we focus on the challenge of** **implementation****: making AI-relevant laws like GDPR and the AI Act work in practice**. This topic has received very limited attention as it requires a deep understanding of both CS and law – which is rare.

To be prepared to respond to new AI challenges in the years ahead, we will also actively build bridges across CS and law, including by organising a set of workshops and conferences on the topic.

**RegTech4AI** will be carried out as part of the <a href="https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/about-um/faculties/law/research/law-and-tech-lab" target="_blank">Law&Tech Lab</a> at Maastricht University, located in the Netherlands and close to Brussels. Over the last 5 years, the Lab grew continuously and now hosts 16 faculty members, with experts in AI law, NLP, and legal data science.

## team

The project team consists of a range of experienced researchers in the domain of applying technical methods to the law (particular in machine learning and data science), one postdoc with interdisciplinary research expertise, and up to five PhD students.
